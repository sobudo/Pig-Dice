## Description
A popular two player dice game where Player 1 rolls the dice and scores as many points as possible, which are added up as he/she goes along. If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over and he loses all points he accumulated that turn. The next player then has a turn. A player can stop his/her turn at any time by clicking 'hold' (you will retain any points you have accumulated up to then). The game passes from player to player. The first player to reach 100 wins.

## Specifications
The program should do the following:

Allow two players to play against each other.

After each roll, a players total number of points must be added up and displayed.

If a player rolls a 1, their total score must return to nil and the computer must inform them their turn is over.

Allow the players to click the hold button and have their accumulated points stored.

Inform the winning player that he has won when appropriate.
